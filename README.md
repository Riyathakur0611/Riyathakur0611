- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Riyathakur0611
-  I'm a curious and adaptable Data Science enthusias with a passion for lifelong learning. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and challenges, and I thrive in environments that encourage growth and innovation.
-  Iâ€™m currently enrolled as undergraduate Engineering student in Coer University,Roorkee.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on  Data Science, Data Analytics, Machine Learning projects.
-  Currently working with following languages and tools:
-  - **Languages**- Python,C,SQL
   - **Frameworks**- Pandas,Numpy,MatplotLib
   - **Tools**- Excel, MySQL, PowerBI
   - **Platform** - Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Jupyter
-  You can find some of my projects here,including:
-  - **Brain Weight Prediction**-Estimating brain weight involves considering factors like body size, gender, age, and genetics. Statistical models and machine learning can be used to predict brain weight based on these factors. Medical imaging techniques also play a role in understanding brain structure and size.
   - **House Price Prediction** - Predicting house prices involves using data analysis to estimate the selling price of a property based on factors like location, property characteristics, and market trends. Common methods include regression analysis and machine learning. Accurate prediction is important for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
